# Awesome Binary Networks

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A curated list of binary neural networks, i.e. networks with weights and/or activations constrainted to {-1; +1} values.

Some variations with weights/activation values {-1;0;+1} or {0:+1} are also included in the list.
